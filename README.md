# Major League Baseball MVP Predictions Using ML
This project is an introduction into Major League Baseball MVP voting patterns. The datafile for this project was created by scraping the voting and player stats off [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2023.shtml) In the future, I plan to compile more intangibles such as their defensive ratings into the algorithm. 

To get started, open up **exploratory_mlb_mvp.ipynb**. Then, you may go to **mlb_mvp_v2.ipynb** in order to look at the models. Finally, the predicted results for the current MLB MVP race are put into Note: file paths may need to be changed if you wish to run it yourself.
