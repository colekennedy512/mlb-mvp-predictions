# Major League Baseball MVP Predictions Using ML
This project is an introduction into Major League Baseball MVP voting patterns. The datafile for this project was created by scraping the voting and player stats off [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2023.shtml). Furthermore, I extracted the current MLB MVP race from [Fox Sports](https://www.foxsports.com/articles/mlb/2024-mlb-mvp-odds-al-and-nl-favorites).

To get started, open up **exploratory_mlb_mvp.ipynb** to get a sense of the datafile the models were trained on. Then, you may go to **mlb_mvp_v2.ipynb** in order to look at the models and how they performed. Finally, the predicted results for the current MLB MVP race are put into **prospects_mlb_mvp.ipynb**. 

Notes: file paths may need to be changed if you wish to run it yourself. Annotations to show my thought process behind this project are still a work in progress.
