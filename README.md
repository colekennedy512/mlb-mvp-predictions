# Major League Baseball MVP Predictions Using ML
This project is an introduction into Major League Baseball MVP voting patterns. The datafile for this project was created by scraping the voting and player stats off [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2023.html) In the future, I plan to compile more intangibles such as their defensive ratings into the algorithm.
